=head1 NAME

My::Module::Build - Extend Module::Build for File::Symlink::Relative

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 perl Build.PL
 ./Build
 ./Build test
 ./Build authortest # supplied by this module
 ./Build install

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This extension of L<Module::Build|Module::Build> adds the following
action to those provided by L<Module::Build|Module::Build>:

  authortest

=head1 ACTIONS

This module provides the following actions:

=head2 authortest

This action runs not only those tests which appear in the F<t>
directory, but those that appear in the F<xt> directory. The F<xt> tests
are provided for information only, since some of them (notably
F<xt/critic.t> and F<xt/pod_spelling.t>) are very sensitive to the
configuration under which they run.

Some of the F<xt> tests require modules that are not named as
requirements. These should disable themselves if the required modules
are not present.

This action is sensitive to the C<verbose=1> argument, but not to the
C<--test_files> argument.

This action also creates the F<META.*> files if needed.

=head2 test

This action overrides the core C<test> action to create the F<META.*>
files if needed.
